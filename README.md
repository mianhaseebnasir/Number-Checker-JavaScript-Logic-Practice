🚀 Number Checker – JavaScript Logic Practice
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
📌 Overview

Number Checker is a clean and structured JavaScript practice project built to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts using Vanilla JavaScript.

The application takes a user’s input number, processes it through conditional logic, and determines whether it is Even or Odd, while also generating a personalized result message.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

This project reflects strong foundational understanding of:

• DOM Manipulation

• Event Handling

• Conditional Logic

• Type Conversion

• User Interaction Flow

It is a beginner-focused project developed with a structured and problem-solving approach.

✨ Key Features

✔ Interactive input form
✔ Dynamic name prompt for personalization
✔ Real-time number validation logic
✔ Even/Odd detection using modulo operator
✔ Result displayed without page reload
✔ Clean and readable code structure

🛠 Tech Stack

• HTML5 – Structure

• JavaScript (ES6) – Logic & Interaction

No external libraries or frameworks were used.
The goal was to practice core JavaScript concepts in a pure environment.

🧠 Core Logic Explanation

The application follows a simple but effective logic flow:

• Capture user input from the form.

• Convert the input value into a Number data type.

• Use the modulo operator % to evaluate:

  • If number % 2 === 0 → Even Number

  • Else → Odd Number

• Dynamically update the result field using DOM manipulation.

• Prevent default form submission to avoid page reload.

🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was built to strengthen:

• Understanding of arithmetic operators

• Logical decision-making using if/else

• JavaScript functions

• Working with document.getElementById

• Preventing default form behavior

• Personalized user interaction using prompt()

🔄 Possible Enhancements

To upgrade this project further:

• Add proper input validation

• Replace prompt() with an input field

• Improve UI with CSS styling

• Add error handling for empty or invalid input

• Convert into a fully responsive mini web app

• Refactor into separate JS file for better structure

💡 Why This Project Matters

Small logic-based projects like this are essential for mastering programming fundamentals.
Before building complex applications, strong control over logic, conditions, and DOM interaction is necessary.

This project represents a foundational step toward advanced JavaScript and full-stack development.
